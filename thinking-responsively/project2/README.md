# TIL

- It's arguably better to start with the typography. If you style the layout first, later setting properties of the fonts could break the layout. Styling the fonts sort of prevents this.
- `bolder` sets the `font-weight` to the next available `font-weight`. If the current `font-weight` is `300`, `bolder` sets it to `400`.
- Using `display: block` for `img` solves a lot of problem you'll ever have with `img`.
- Flex `order` attribute. Negative and Positive order values.
- Breakpoints are not device-specific, they are layout-specific. Set your breakpoints based on the layout and not on devices.
- `object-fit`, `object-position`.
